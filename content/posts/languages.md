## Future 

I take a futuristic standpoint in this post. Consider every sentence where I use the word "will" - as in, has not happened yet.

## Language Value 

How do you value a language?

While this is personal, I value it by how many speakers *will* speak it within the next 10 years. 

Experts predict this will be: 
-   Spanish 
-   Mandarin Chinese
-   English 


Another way I like to value languages are by how it could affect my work (tech).

In this case, I think about how the future of the tech industry and how it is going to continue to globalize.

As it globalizes, the region with most people *will* most likely dominate. As a result, countries with languages that *will* have the most speakers, *will* become dominate in tech as well. 

These include the countries as mentioned before: 
-   Spanish
-   Mandarin Chinese
-   English

I would also like to point hindi. I think it is important as well, and I would love to learn it later in life, but it would have to be after Mandarin Chinese since I already know Spanish and English.
