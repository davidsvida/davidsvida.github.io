EC2 is a general-purpose virtual machine service that can be used to host various types of applications, including containerized applications. To host containers on EC2, you would typically install a container runtime, such as Docker, on the EC2 instances and manage the containers manually or using a third-party container orchestration tool.

ECS, on the other hand, is a fully-managed container orchestration service that simplifies the process of running and managing containers on the cloud. With ECS, you don't have to manage the underlying infrastructure, as AWS takes care of the provisioning, scaling, and monitoring of the underlying infrastructure. You simply define the container images, resource requirements, and networking configuration, and ECS takes care of the rest.

In summary, while both EC2 and ECS can be used to host containers, ECS provides a more streamlined and automated approach to container hosting, whereas EC2 provides more flexibility and control over the underlying infrastructure.
