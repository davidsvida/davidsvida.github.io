## What are Cloud Native Applications?

Cloud native applications are applications that are built and designed to leverage cloud computing frameworks. They are developed with modern methodologies to provide flexibility, efficiency, and robustness in the cloud environment. These applications are rapidly becoming the new normal in the world of software development due to their numerous advantages.

## Key Features of Cloud Native Applications

- **Microservices Architecture**: This allows developers to break down applications into smaller, manageable services that can function independently. 

- **Containerization**: Cloud native applications often use containers for deployment. Containers bundle up the code and its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

- **Continuous Delivery**: Cloud native applications support the principles of continuous integration and continuous delivery, making it easier to adapt to changes.

- **Scalability**: These applications can automatically scale up and down depending on the need, thus optimizing resources and reducing costs.

- **Resiliency**: Cloud native applications are designed to anticipate failure. They can quickly recover from any failure, ensuring a higher level of service availability.

## FAQs

1. **What is the difference between cloud-based and cloud-native applications?**

   Cloud-based applications are only hosted on a cloud infrastructure. However, cloud-native applications are not only hosted on the cloud but also specifically designed to leverage the cloud's unique properties.

2. **Why should my business consider moving to cloud-native applications?**

   Cloud-native applications provide numerous benefits such as faster time to market, improved scalability, and reduced operational costs. These attributes make them an excellent choice for businesses looking to stay competitive in today's digital landscape.

3. **What skills are needed to develop cloud-native applications?**

   Developers need a strong understanding of cloud computing concepts, experience with microservices architecture, knowledge of container technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, and familiarity with DevOps practices.

4. **What skills are the most valuable for cloud computing**

   My answer the this questions would be Cloud-native development - since more and more applications are being developed specifically for the cloud, cloud engineers will need to have a deep understanding of cloud-native development frameworks and tools, such as Kubernetes, Docker, and serverless computing.
