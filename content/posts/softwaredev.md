## What makes up Software Development

- Mobile app development: Developing applications for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. This involves writing code for iOS or Android platforms, or using cross-platform frameworks such as React Native or Flutter.
- Desktop app development: Developing applications that run on desktop operating systems such as Windows, macOS, or Linux. This involves writing code using programming languages such as Java, C#, or Python.
- Game development: Developing video games for consoles, PCs, or mobile devices. This involves writing code using game engines such as Unity or Unreal Engine, or using programming languages such as C++ or C#.
- Artificial intelligence and machine learning: Developing applications that can learn and make decisions based on data. This involves using programming languages such as Python or R, and frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- DevOps: Developing and maintaining the infrastructure and tools necessary for software development, including continuous integration and deployment, monitoring, and automation. This involves using tools such as Git, Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes.

These are just a few examples of the many areas of software development. Each area requires different skills and knowledge, and can offer different opportunities for career growth and development.



In addition to software development, there are many other areas within the broader field of technology and coding. Here are a few examples:

1. Data Science: Data science involves using statistical and computational methods to extract insights from large and complex datasets. Data scientists work with data engineers to collect, store, and clean data, and then use machine learning algorithms and other techniques to analyze the data and make predictions.

2. Cybersecurity: Cybersecurity involves protecting computer systems and networks from unauthorized access, theft, and damage. Cybersecurity professionals work to identify and mitigate security risks, and to develop policies and procedures to protect sensitive data and systems.

3. Web Development: Web development involves creating websites and web applications using programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Web developers work with designers to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites, and with back-end developers to ensure that the website's functionality is working correctly.

4. Hardware Engineering: Hardware engineering involves designing and building physical components of computer systems, such as circuit boards, processors, and sensors. Hardware engineers work with software developers to create products that work seamlessly together.

5. Product Management: Product management involves overseeing the development and launch of new products, from ideation to launch. Product managers work with engineers, designers, and other stakeholders to ensure that the product meets the needs of the user and is launched on time and on budget.

These are just a few examples of the many areas within the field of technology and coding. Each area requires a unique set of skills and expertise, but all share a common goal of creating products and solutions that improve people's lives.
