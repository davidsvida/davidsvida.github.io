## App Tech

If I were to build an app startup, this is the tech I would use

1. **Compute**
    - Containers: Docker, Kubernetes
    - Virtual Machines: EC2 (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud)
    - Serverless Computing: Lambda (AWS Lambda)
    - Microservices: Kubernetes

2. **Networking**
    - Virtual Network: AWS VPC (Amazon Virtual Private Cloud)
    - Load Balancer: AWS ELB (Amazon Elastic Load Balancing)
    - Content Delivery Network: Cloudflare

3. **Storage**
    - Object Storage: Amazon S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service)
    - Block Storage: AWS EBS (Amazon Elastic Block Store)
    - File Storage: Amazon EFS (Amazon Elastic File System)

4. **Database**
    - Managed Relational Database: Amazon RDS (Amazon Relational Database Service)
    - NoSQL Database: DynamoDB (Amazon DynamoDB)
    - In-Memory Database: Redis
    - Data Warehousing: Amazon Redshift

5. **Big Data Processing**
    - Apache Hadoop 
    - Apache Spark

6. **Machine Learning**
    - Amazon SageMaker

7. **Security**
    - Identity and Access Management: Okta
    - Encryption: Amazon KMS (Amazon Key Management Service)
    - Firewalls: Amazon WAF (Amazon Web Application Firewall)

8. **Monitoring and Logging**

9. **Development & Operations (DevOps)**
    - Continuous Integration and Deployment: Jenkins
    - Infrastructure as Code: Terraform


However, building a successful  app requires more than just choosing the right technology stack. It requires a deep understanding of the business needs and requirements, as well as expertise in software development, project management, and user experience design.

It's also important to note that the success of an enterprise app is not solely dependent on the technology stack. Other factors, such as market demand, competition, and business strategy, can also play a significant role in determining the success of an enterprise app.

##  Additional (TBT) 

1. **Message Queue Services**: For asynchronous processing and communication between services. Examples: Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service), Apache Kafka.

2. **API Gateway**: For managing, securing, and scaling APIs. Example: Amazon API Gateway.

3. **Caching Services**: To speed up data retrieval operations. Example: Amazon ElastiCache.

4. **Serverless Workflow Service**: For orchestrating serverless workflows. Example: AWS Step Functions.

5. **Backup Services**: For protecting and restoring your data. Example: AWS Backup.

6. **Server Management Tools**: For automating server management tasks. Example: AWS OpsWorks.

7. **Container Orchestration Tools**: If you are using Docker, Kubernetes isn't the only option. There are others like Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service).
