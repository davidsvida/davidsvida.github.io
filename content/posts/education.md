Youtube Script: 

A quick advisor before I start the video, none of this would have been possible without my amazing parents who supported me and allowed me to live such an amazing life. I am fortunate to be supported financially to do anything I put my mind to. This is due to the fact that my parents immigrated to the USA from Mexico so that their kids would have the opportunities that come with being born in America. Ok, now let the video start 

What is education?

According to the Oxford Dictionary, education is defined as “the process of receiving or giving **systematic** instruction, especially at a school or university. 

I want you to know focus on systematic.

Now what is systematic? 

According to Oxford Dictionaries, again, systematic means “done or acting according to a fixed plan or system”

I want you to keep these definitions in the back of your head as I briefly explain my educational career. 

Ok, so my educational career was as such: 

I dropped out of highschool, started online high school. Finished online high school, started homeschool. Finished homeschool, took my SAT. Did well on my SAT, got into University. Did well in University, dropped out of University. Started online university, did well in online university. Finished online university, and now am recording this video. 

From this brief explanation of my educational career, *you can not say I was educated*.

To be educated is to be a person who is, by definition, able to *receive systematic instruction.*

I am terrible at receiving systematic instruction, which again, systematic meaning to be done or to be acted upon in a fixed plan or system. 

I noticed that I was terrible at this since I was young, I would always get distracted in school and was then diagnosed with ADHD when I was 8 as a result. 

My school career up until I reached highschool was driven by taking stimulant ADHD pills every single day so that I could focus in school. 

Once I dropped out of highschool, I spent a lot of time alone. Thinking about how I deceived my parents and also about what I would do next. The fact that my brother goes to stanford and is going to med school soon did not help my failure son mentality at all. 

After dropping out, I then enrolled in online high school since I figured it was the only option. 

While I was doing online high school I saw a ted talk about how some girl went to stanford at like 11 or something and I was shocked. I kept on researching about how people were going to amazing schools so young and I found that they were all home schooled. Perhaps I researched so much because I saw an opportunity to fix my failure son image that was still driving me crazy. 

I looked into the homeschool scene and found that homeschooling is different according to state. Thankfully, my state had very lenient laws and I was able to plan out the fastest way to graduate in accordance to these laws. At the same time, I was preparing for the SAT since I knew it could help my application if I wanted to apply to these top schools. 

The SAT test came am I did well - I took it when I was 15; however I knew my application was not strong enough to get into these top schools and I had to let that dream of mine go. 

Regardless of my dream to go to an amazing ivy league being dead, I still knew that my score alone was able to get me into many other universities besides those top schools, and so I applied to university.

I got in when I was 16. The university was 30 minutes away so I decided to move out of my house to be closer to the university. 

I liked university and I did well, but it was the same problem I had with other educational systems like high school. It was systematic. 

While attending University, I met Angela, and my world opened to new ideas and possibilities. We fell in love and I moved to Spain. I am recording this in Spain. The decision to move to spain was based on the idea of systemic education. I knew I couldn't do a systemic system for 4 years in traditional university but I also new I had to get a degree. My only option to get a degree and to live in spain was to attend online university. Right now I am finishing up online university and it is systemic and I do not like it but I finished it in 6 months. I would say I finished it so quickly by just being extremely persistent and keeping in mind that after I get the degree, I could potentially work. And so that is the next step for me right now, to work. 

As for how I will deal with the systematic world we live in? I am not sure how my future will play out, but I do think systematic organizations work for some and do not work for others but there is a big shift in letting engineers and other creatives, work on what they want to work on, since ultimately that is when the best work is done. Of course, before spending time working on something, it is important to ensure that the actual work is well thought out and will be the most productive and beneficial towards achieving the mission, but ultimately if it is going to be the most productive and beneficial it will have to be something you are passionate about and want to work on.

This idea of getting to work on what you want as an engineer sounds amazing, it is almost like you never have to work! Well, as for considering work, work, I think it will always have to be work and a world where you love working so much that you don't consider it work is idealistic and impossible. Although thinking positively and idealistic ly can achieve great results so maybe it is helpful to think that way. 

Okay, that is all for this video though. This video will perhaps serve as a guide for anyone who wants to learn about my education journey, or who knows.
