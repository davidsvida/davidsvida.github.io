## May 20 2023

I just had a talk with my friend Sammy and I was reflecting on how much we have changed. 

I was thinking about how my life has changed this past year. I would say this past year has been a year of growth and change - something we should strive for in terms of self-improvement. 

The change I noticed today after talking to Sammy, was how our conversations seemed different. Perhaps because it was virtual, but it does not feel the same. We now talk about college and advice when we used to talk about parties and high school drama. We are maturing and thus our conversations will change so it is destined to happen as we all grow older but it is still hard to process and reflect upon. 

Is this something good? Do I want to mature? Is this what maturing actually is? Is our relationship dimming? And many questions like this cross my mind. 

I am scared to grow up and become more mature and experience more, but I will have to; and as I grow and learn, I hope to be the best version of myself that I can be.
