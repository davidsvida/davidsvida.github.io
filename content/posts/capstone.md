## Project 

As of now, I plan for this to be an e-commerce site. Exactly what I will do in regards to cloud computing is tbt.

## Inspo

-   [**reactioncommerce / reaction:**](https://github.com/reactioncommerce/reaction) An API-first, headless commerce platform built using Node.js, React, and GraphQL. This would be a good choice if you're interested in JavaScript, especially in a full-stack JavaScript environment, and want to learn more about GraphQL and the concept of headless commerce.

-   [**saleor / saleor:**](https://github.com/saleor/saleor) A high performance, composable, headless commerce API built using Python. This is a good choice if you're interested in Python and want to see how it can be used in a high-performance eCommerce context.

### Other 

opencart / opencart: An open-source PHP-based online e-commerce solution. Like PrestaShop, OpenCart is a complete eCommerce platform, but it's simpler and easier to use and modify, which might make it a good choice if you're new to programming.
