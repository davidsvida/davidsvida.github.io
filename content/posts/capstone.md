Before reading this post, it is important to not that every deployment was made with the respective services free tier. 



## Project 

I plan for this to be an e-commerce site. Exactly what I will **do** in regards to cloud computing is to be determined.

Although I care a lot about simplicity, this not so simple project was a requirement for my WGU degree. Thus, I figured I could share for those interested. [Capstone Proposal Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rcn6qeFZOUa9Sq3wkDZB62CjCraWIxdX/view)

To compare your AWS solution against Google App Engine, you can create a table or a side-by-side comparison discussing various factors such as cost, flexibility, scalability, ease of use, performance, and customization. Here's an example of how you can compare the two solutions:

| Criteria          | AWS Solution                          | Google App Engine                   |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Cost              | Pay-as-you-go, various pricing plans | Pay-as-you-go, free tier available  |
| Flexibility       | High, supports multiple languages     | Moderate, limited language support |
| Scalability       | Highly scalable, auto-scaling         | Highly scalable, auto-scaling       |
| Ease of Use       | Moderate, steeper learning curve      | Easy, simplified app deployment     |
| Performance       | High, customizable performance        | Moderate, less customizable         |
| Customization     | High, granular control                | Moderate, some limitations          |
| Vendor Lock-in    | Moderate                              | Moderate                            |
| Integration       | Extensive AWS ecosystem               | Google Cloud Platform services      |
| Security          | Comprehensive security features       | Robust security features            |

You can further elaborate on each criterion by providing more details and specific examples. Additionally, consider the following points to help you compare the two solutions:

1. Focus on the specific needs and requirements of the CartWise E-commerce application. Determine how each solution aligns with those needs.

2. Analyze the ease of migration and integration with existing systems and third-party tools.

3. Discuss the long-term implications of choosing each solution, such as potential future updates, expansion, or growth.

4. Address any unique features or services offered by each platform that might be particularly beneficial or limiting to CartWise E-commerce.

5. Compare the support, documentation, and community resources available for each platform. This can impact the ease of implementation and ongoing management.

By providing a detailed and objective comparison, you can help your audience make an informed decision about the most suitable solution for CartWise E-commerce.

To collect data about different deployment options, you can follow these steps:

1. **Research and gather information**: Start by researching the official documentation, whitepapers, and case studies provided by each deployment option (e.g., AWS, Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure, etc.). These resources often contain valuable insights, performance metrics, and technical specifications.

2. **Consult online forums and communities**: Visit online forums, discussion boards, and social media groups related to the deployment options. Engage with other users who have experience deploying applications on these platforms. You can ask questions, learn from their experiences, and gather user-generated insights.

3. **Analyze case studies**: Study existing case studies of companies that have successfully deployed their e-commerce applications using the various deployment options. This will provide you with real-world examples of the pros and cons of each solution, as well as insights into performance, cost, and scalability.

4. **Request quotes and pricing information**: Reach out to the sales or support teams of each deployment option to get pricing information specific to your project. This will allow you to create a cost comparison based on your application's requirements.

5. **Contact experts and consultants**: If possible, consult with experts or professionals in the field who have experience in deploying e-commerce applications using different deployment options. They can provide advice, best practices, and recommendations tailored to your specific needs.

6. **Test each deployment option**: If feasible, set up a small-scale testing environment for each deployment option. This will help you evaluate each solution's performance, ease of use, and capabilities firsthand.

7. **Benchmarking**: Collect performance metrics (e.g., response times, latency, throughput, etc.) for each deployment option. Use benchmarking tools to compare the performance of each platform under various conditions and workloads.

8. **Evaluate support and documentation**: Assess the quality of documentation, support resources, and community engagement for each platform. This can impact the ease of implementation, ongoing management, and troubleshooting.

Once you have collected the data, organize it into a meaningful comparison that highlights the differences and similarities between the deployment options. This will help you make an informed decision about the most suitable deployment option for your e-commerce application.

To organize the collected data in an attractive and concise manner, you can create a visually appealing infographic or presentation that highlights the key findings and comparisons. Here's an outline you can follow:

1. **Introduction**: Briefly introduce the objective of the comparison and the deployment options being considered (e.g., AWS, Google App Engine, etc.).

2. **Key criteria**: List the main criteria used for the comparison, such as cost, scalability, flexibility, ease of use, performance, customization, and vendor lock-in.

3. **Comparison table**: Create a table that compares each deployment option based on the key criteria. Use colors and icons to make the table visually appealing and easy to understand.

4. **Case studies**: Include real-world examples of companies that have successfully deployed their e-commerce applications using the different deployment options. Provide a brief overview of their experiences, along with any relevant metrics or results.

5. **Performance metrics**: Present the benchmarking results for each deployment option in the form of graphs, charts, or other visualizations. This will make it easier for employers to compare the performance of each platform.

6. **Conclusion**: Summarize the findings and offer a recommendation based on the comparison. Explain why you believe the recommended deployment option is the best fit for the project.

Regarding step 7, here's a more detailed explanation of how to collect real metrics for each service:

1. **Set up test environments**: Create small-scale test environments for each deployment option (AWS, Google App Engine, etc.) using similar configurations and resource allocation. Ensure that the test environments are as identical as possible to make the comparison fair.

2. **Create sample applications**: Develop sample applications that are representative of your e-commerce project. Use similar technology stacks, libraries, and frameworks for each deployment option.

3. **Define performance metrics**: Identify the key performance metrics you want to measure, such as response time, latency, throughput, resource utilization, or error rates.

4. **Use benchmarking tools**: Employ benchmarking tools and software to simulate different workloads and measure the performance metrics for each deployment option. Some popular tools include JMeter, Gatling, and Loader.io. Make sure to use the same tools and settings for each platform to maintain consistency in the measurements.

5. **Run tests**: Execute the tests under various conditions, such as low, medium, and high loads, or different network environments. This will help you understand how each deployment option performs under different circumstances.

6. **Collect and analyze data**: Record the performance metrics for each deployment option during the tests. Analyze the results to identify trends, patterns, or anomalies.

7. **Visualize the results**: Use graphs, charts, or other visual representations to display the collected metrics. This will make it easier to compare the performance of each platform.

By following these steps, you can collect real metrics about each service and provide a thorough comparison that will be valuable to employers evaluating your project.
