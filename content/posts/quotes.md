### Problem Solving 
**If I had an hour to solve a problem, I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions**

### To do so
Be the one who goes first 

Introduce yourself first, help a stranger first, say hello first, 

because life rewards those who go first, those who initiate and not those who wait for others
