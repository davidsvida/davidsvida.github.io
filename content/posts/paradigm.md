A programming paradigm is a way to classify programming languages and these languages are split into two components. 

1. Semantics (function) - refers to the meaning behind the code, such as what a particular command or function does. 
2. Syntax (form) - refers to the rules and structure of a programming language, such as how code is written and formatted.

*Semantics and Syntax usually define programming languages*

## Paradigms

* Imperative 
    * procedural 
    * object-oriented 
* Declarative 
    * functional 
    * logic 
    * reactive 

### Imperative programming
 This paradigm involves commands for the computer to perform actions. It focuses on describing how a program operates.

* procedural: relies on a sequence of steps to solve a problem (C, Pascal, and FORTRAN)
* object-oriented: uses 'objects' (instances of classes) which are organized around data and behavior. (Python, Java, and C++)


### Declarative programming
This paradigm expresses the logic of a computation without describing its control flow. It focuses on what the program should accomplish.

* functional: programs are executed by evaluating expressions, avoiding changing-state and mutable data. This paradigm emphasizes the application of functions, in contrast to the procedural programming style, which emphasizes changes in state(Haskell, Lisp, and Erlang)
* logic: a set of logical statements (system of facts and rules), and the execution engine will try to make these statements true in which this process could possibly derive new facts (Prolog)
* reactive: allows for efficient execution of parallel tasks and manages back-pressure (when the system is over-stressed with requests). Good for non-blocking, event-driven apps (ReactJS, RXJava, and Akka)
