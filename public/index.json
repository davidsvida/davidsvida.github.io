Languages can be viewed through two components.\nSemantics (function) - refers to the meaning behind the code, such as what a particular command or function does.\nSyntax (form) - refers to the rules and structure of a programming language, such as how code is written and formatted.\nTogether, semantics and syntax define a language\nAdditionally, languages can be defined by its specification or a implementation\nLanguage specification - a formal description of its syntax and semantics.\nLanguage implementation - the actual software that reads programs (compile or interprets) and executes it.\nSpecification\u0026rsquo;s are nice because they leave no ambiguity in the language\u0026rsquo;s interpretation and the implementation is what brings the specification to life\nSemantics The semantics of a programming language refers to the meaning of its elements - the \u0026ldquo;what happens\u0026rdquo; when the code is executed.\nData types and Structures\nEvery language has its own set of data types (such as integers, strings, or booleans) and structures (like arrays or objects). What happens when you manipulate these components and how these components react with other components ultimately dictate the language\u0026rsquo;s semantics. Control Flow\nThis is how the code execution is controlled (including loops, conditional statements, and functions)\nDefines the order of execution, what is executed, how to make decisions, and to handle subroutines\nError Handling\nDefines how the language handles errors Throwing exceptions, logging errors, or halting execution. Memory Management\nHow memory is used and allocated/deallocated Includes variable creation/destruction and garbage collection Concurrency and Parallelism\nDepends if language supports it Essentially defines how multiple tasks will be done simultaneously Semantics can vary significantly from one language to another.\nSyntax Syntax refers to a set of rules that define how programs written in the language must be structured. Syntax is made of lexical elements and grammatical structure.\nLexical elements and grammatical structure are what govern how statements and expressions are correctly formed. Lexical Elements:\nThese are the basic components of a language. They include keywords (like if, else, for), identifiers (variable or function names), operators (+, -, *, /), literals (like 1, \u0026quot;hello\u0026quot;), and punctuation symbols ({}, (), ,).\nGrammatical Structure (Syntax):\nThis defines how the basic components can be combined to form valid statements or expressions in the language. For example, an if statement in Python is written as if condition: statement, where condition is an expression that evaluates to a boolean value and statement is the code that gets executed if the condition is true.\nProgramming languages, such as C, C++, and Java, have syntax that is based on the C programming language which is very concise syntax. Other programming languages, such as Python, Ruby, and JavaScript, have very readable syntax.\nImportant Low-level vs High-level Languages\nProgramming languages are classified as low-level or high-level depending on abstraction from the hardware.\nLow-level languages (assembly languages or C) have little abstraction from the computerâ€™s instruction set architecture. They offer high control over the hardware but require a lot knowledge about the computer\u0026rsquo;s architecture and memory model.\nHigh-level languages (Python or Java) abstract the precise hardware details. They have features like garbage collection and bounds checking that make them easier to use but perhaps less performant for very specific tasks.\nScripting vs System Languages\nScripting languages (Python,JavaScript) are typically used for short and simple tasks. They are interpreted rather than compiled, and they have features good for text processing or automating system tasks.\nSystem languages (C,Rust) are used for writing operating systems and other low-level applications. They give close control over system resources and are compiled to machine code\nInterpreter vs Compiler\nAn Interpreter reads and executes the code line by line. If there is an error, it stops at that line and reports it - making it easier to debug. Every time the program is ran, an interpreter has to translate the source code into machine code.\nA Compiler converts the entire source code into machine code before the program is run. If there is an error, it is reported during the compilation step and the program doesn\u0026rsquo;t run until all errors are resolved - making it harder to debug. Once the program is compiled, it can be run multiple times without further translation\nThe choice between an interpreted language and a compiled language doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter as much as it used to.\nJava compiles into bytecode and then gets interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers can compile before execution. Static vs Dynamic Typing\nIn statically-typed languages (C++,Java) you must declare a variable\u0026rsquo;s type ahead of time and it can\u0026rsquo;t change\nIn dynamically-typed languages (Python,Ruby) you do not have to declare a variable\u0026rsquo;s type and it can be of any type.\nAn easy and intuitive example is that in a statically-typed language, if you declare a variable as an integer, you cannot later assign a string to it where as in a dynamically-typed language you can assign any type of value to the variable without having to declare it.\nType System\nA type system is a collection of rules that assign a property called a \u0026ldquo;type\u0026rdquo; to the programming constructs (variables, expressions, functions or modules) a computer program is composed of. A \u0026ldquo;type\u0026rdquo; is used to reduce the possibility for bugs in programs by defining the connections between different parts of a computer program, and then checking that they are connected in a consistent way.\nAn easy and intuitive example is declaring a variable of type \u0026ldquo;integer\u0026rdquo; and assigning it a value of 5. The type system will give a type error because it ensures that the variable can only hold integer values Intended Use: System, General, Specific, Script\nSystem languages are used for system programming, to develop the core functioning parts of an operating system\nGeneral-purpose languages are used to write software that will be used for a wide variety of applications.\nSpecific-purpose languages are for a specific domain, like SQL for databases or HTML for web pages.\nScripting languages are used for small tasks like text processing or network scripting.\nStandard library and run-time system\nEvery language comes with a set of built-in functions, classes, and modules that form its standard library - providing utilities for tasks Runtime system refers to the software/hardware environment within which a program runs.

Containers and virtual machines are technologies that provide isolated environments for running software applications. They\u0026rsquo;re used in deploying and managing applications, and they help address challenges related to compatibility, portability, and resource utilization.\nHow are containers and virtual machines similar? Both containers and virtual machines are designed to encapsulate an application along with its environment. This encapsulation includes the application itself, its dependencies, libraries, and other binaries. The goal is to enable the application to run reliably and consistently across different computing environments.\nHow are containers and virtual machines different? The key difference between containers and virtual machines lies in their architectural approach. Virtual machines each contain a full copy of an operating system, a virtual copy of the hardware that the OS runs on, and an application and its associated libraries and dependencies.\nContainers, on the other hand, share the host system\u0026rsquo;s operating system and isolate just the applications from each other. Each container includes the application and its dependencies. This makes containers more lightweight and requires less overhead than VMs.\nWhat are the advantages of containers? Containers are lightweight, start up quickly, and require less computational resources than virtual machines, as they share the host system\u0026rsquo;s OS kernel. This efficiency means you can have more containers than VMs on a given host. Containers are also highly portable, as the container encapsulates everything the application needs to run.\nWhat are the advantages of virtual machines? Virtual machines offer stronger isolation than containers, as each VM runs its own operating system. This makes VMs a better choice for running applications that need all the resources and functionalities of a standalone system. VMs are also a better fit for running applications that require different operating systems.\nWhen should I use containers and when should I use virtual machines? Containers are ideal for applications that can be broken down into microservices, maximizing the number of applications running on a single server. They are also great for creating reproducible development environments.\nVirtual machines are useful when you need to run applications that require all the resources and functionalities of a standalone system, or when you need to run different operating systems on the same machine.\n","permalink":"https://davidinsider.com/posts/contvsvirt/","summary":"What are containers and virtual machines?

Microservices are a software development approach in which applications are broken down into small, independent (micro)services that work together to provide a larger overall system.\nHow do they work though? Each microservice is responsible for a specific capability and communicate with other microservices through API\u0026rsquo;s or other lightweight messaging protocols.\nFor example, let\u0026rsquo;s say you have a user authentication service, a product catalog service, and a payment processing service. Each of these services would be responsible for a specific function within the application and would communicate with each other through APIs or other lightweight messaging protocols\nHow do I use them in my app Identify Identify the different business functions of your application. Determine which functions can be broken down into smaller, independent services. Each microservice should be responsible for a single business function. Develope Develop each microservice independently. Each microservice should communicate with other microservices through APIs or other lightweight messaging protocols. Microservices can be developed using different programming languages, frameworks, and tools. Test Test each microservice independently. Test each microservice in combination with other microservices. Use automated testing tools to ensure that each microservice is functioning as expected. Deploy Deploy each microservice independently. Use containerization tools like Docker to package each microservice. Use orchestration tools like Kubernetes to manage and scale your microservices. Containerization Tools Containerization tools like Docker allow you to encapsulate each microservice within an isolated container, which includes all the required dependencies and runtime environment. By packaging microservices into individual containers, you can ensure consistent behavior across different stages of development, deployment, and production. Moreover, containerization helps in simplifying the management and scaling of complex systems, as each service can be updated, replaced, or scaled independently.\nOrchestration Tools Orchestration tools like Kubernetes play a crucial role in managing and scaling microservices. Kubernetes automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, taking the burden of manual deployment and resource allocation off your shoulders. It ensures your services are always running in the most efficient manner possible, adjusting to traffic patterns and system needs dynamically.\nBenefits Developers can use different programming languages, frameworks, and tools for each microservice as needed, which can help improve development speed and agility. Microservices are designed to be highly modular and scalable, so that developers can easily add or remove services as needed to meet changing business requirements. Microservices can help improve fault tolerance and resilience, as failures in one microservice are less likely to affect the entire system Microservices can help reduce the complexity of large applications, as each service can be developed, tested, and deployed independently. Challenges Microservices can require additional effort to ensure that services are secure and protected from malicious attacks, which can increase development and testing time. Microservices can require additional overhead, such as the need for containerization and orchestration tools, which can increase development and deployment costs. Microservices can require additional effort to ensure that services are communicating effectively with each other, which can increase development and testing time. Example This will go through incorporating Docker and Kubernetes into a microservices architecture with the example of an e-commerce application.\nOur e-commerce application consists of several microservices, such as a product catalog service, a shopping cart service, and a payment service. Each microservice would be responsible for a specific function, and they would communicate with each other through APIs.\nContainerization with Docker: Docker can be used to package each microservice into a separate container. This involves creating a Dockerfile for each microservice which contains instructions for Docker about how to build an image for that microservice. For instance, the product catalog service might have a Dockerfile that specifies the base OS, the version of Python or Java to install, any dependencies like libraries or frameworks, and the code of the service itself. When this Dockerfile is built using the Docker build command, it results in a Docker image, which can then be run anywhere Docker is installed, ensuring consistent behavior across different environments.\nOrchestration with Kubernetes: Kubernetes comes in to help manage and scale these Docker containers. It can automatically distribute the load between containers, scale the services up and down based on traffic, and ensure high availability and fault tolerance. To use Kubernetes, you create configuration files, typically written in YAML, that define the desired state of your system - the services you want to run, how many replicas of each, how they should communicate, etc. Kubernetes then works to make the actual state of the system match the desired state. Let\u0026rsquo;s say your payment service is experiencing high traffic. If you\u0026rsquo;ve configured Kubernetes to auto-scale based on CPU usage or number of requests, it will automatically create more replicas of the payment service to handle the load. These replicas are distributed across different nodes (servers), ensuring that if one node goes down, the service can continue running on the others.\nLinking Docker and Kubernetes: Docker and Kubernetes work together seamlessly. Kubernetes can pull Docker images from a registry like Docker Hub or Google Container Registry, and then run those images as containers. In our e-commerce example, once the Docker images for the product catalog service, shopping cart service, and payment service have been pushed to a Docker registry, Kubernetes can pull those images and run them as separate services. Kubernetes ensures that these services can communicate with each other and scale independently. This way, Docker and Kubernetes can greatly simplify the deployment, management, and scaling of microservices in a complex application.\nWhen not to use microservices For example, if you\u0026rsquo;re developing a simple application or a prototype, microservices may add unnecessary complexity. Similarly, if your application doesn\u0026rsquo;t require a high level of scalability or fault tolerance, microservices may not be necessary. Additionally, microservices can add additional overhead, such as the need for containerization and orchestration tools, which can increase development and deployment costs. Ultimately, it\u0026rsquo;s up to developers to decide whether microservices are the right fit for their specific application and business requirements.\nVideo Microservices Explained in 5 Minutes Kubernetes vs. Docker ","permalink":"https://davidinsider.com/posts/microservices/","summary":"What are microservices?

Cloud native applications are applications that are built and designed to leverage cloud computing frameworks. They are developed with modern methodologies to provide flexibility, efficiency, and robustness in the cloud environment. These applications are rapidly becoming the new normal in the world of software development due to their numerous advantages.\nKey Features of Cloud Native Applications Microservices Architecture: This allows developers to break down applications into smaller, manageable services that can function independently.\nContainerization: Cloud native applications often use containers for deployment. Containers bundle up the code and its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.\nContinuous Delivery: Cloud native applications support the principles of continuous integration and continuous delivery, making it easier to adapt to changes.\nScalability: These applications can automatically scale up and down depending on the need, thus optimizing resources and reducing costs.\nResiliency: Cloud native applications are designed to anticipate failure. They can quickly recover from any failure, ensuring a higher level of service availability.\nFAQs What is the difference between cloud-based and cloud-native applications?\nCloud-based applications are only hosted on a cloud infrastructure. However, cloud-native applications are not only hosted on the cloud but also specifically designed to leverage the cloud\u0026rsquo;s unique properties.\nWhy should my business consider moving to cloud-native applications?\nCloud-native applications provide numerous benefits such as faster time to market, improved scalability, and reduced operational costs. These attributes make them an excellent choice for businesses looking to stay competitive in today\u0026rsquo;s digital landscape.\nWhat skills are needed to develop cloud-native applications?\nDevelopers need a strong understanding of cloud computing concepts, experience with microservices architecture, knowledge of container technologies like Docker and Kubernetes, and familiarity with DevOps practices.\nWhat skills are the most valuable for cloud computing\nMy answer the this questions would be Cloud-native development - since more and more applications are being developed specifically for the cloud, cloud engineers will need to have a deep understanding of cloud-native development frameworks and tools, such as Kubernetes, Docker, and serverless computing.\n","permalink":"https://davidinsider.com/posts/cloud/","summary":"What is cloud computing Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services over the internet, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence.\nCloud Computing Models Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Platform as a Service (PaaS) Software as a Service (SaaS Function as a Service (FaaS) What are Cloud Native Applications?
